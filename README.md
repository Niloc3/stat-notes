# If you feel good about the practice quizzes you should be good for the quiz. Make sure you get BOTH because they cover different parts.

## Ones most people missed on practice #1:

### Question 4:

> Which is true?
I. Random scatter in the residuals indicates a model with high predictive power.
**- FALSE because this is indicating a linear model is appropriate not anything about the strenth**

II. If two variables are very strongly associated, then the correlation between them will be near +1.0 or -1.0.
**- FALSE: Highlighting difference between accociation and correlation, strong accociation could be anything, could be a strong accociation for a parabola or log or whatever but it would have a low correlation because it is not LINEAR.**

III. The higher the correlation between two variables the more likely the association is based in cause and effect.
** - FALSE: correlation is not causation**



### Question 5:
> Two variables that are actually not related to each other may nonetheless have a very high correlation because they both result from some other, possibly hidden, factor. This is an example of
  a. an outlier.
  b. leverage.
  c. a lurking variable.
  d. extrapolation.
  e. regression.

**While most didn't miss this, there will most likely be a question like this on the test but with a different answer, so make sure to know all of the vocab.**

### Question 6:

> If the point in the upper right corner of this scatterplot is removed from the data set, then what will happen to the slope of the line of best fit (b) and to the correlation (r) ?

**b will decrease, and r will increase.**
The point is pulling the slope up and when it is removed then it will come down therefor decreasing. The r value will then get stronger because there is one less point with a large residual

**Know the assumptions and what conditions need to be met for each of them** (Question 10 type question)

**You will need to write the equation.** DONT FORGET "PREDICTED" OR THE LITTLE HAT ON TOP

**Anything past Q10 on the practice expect to be a write out or fill in the blank.**
